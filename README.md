# Overview

To start a test server, run `npm start` after installing of the nessasary decencies. Then a web server should open on `http://localhost:3000/` unless you already have something running on that port.

When designing websites and mobile apps I always struggle to pick color palettes. So I made this app to display random color palates so that I can get a bunch of ideas very quickly.

# Web Pages

There is only one web page, it dynamically creates color palettes every time you click on the generate `New Palette Button`. You can also copy each color by cliking on the button to the right of the color hex code.

# Development Environment

I used  VS Code as my code editor and npm as the packet manager. The code is written in JavaScript using React.js. I used the Lucide React module to help build the buttons on the page.

# Useful Websites

* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/react/)
* [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/)

# Future Work

* Add a lock function so that the user can keep the colors that they like and regenerate the other ones
* Add a database so that the user can save color palettes that they like
* Add a share function so that the user can work collaboratively with others
